      <h3>Disinfection & Cleaning</h3>
<p>We develop customized disinfection and cleaning solutions using our antibacterial master liquid, tailored for specific environments, surfaces, and equipment. Each formulation balances strong antimicrobial performance with safety for people and materials.</p>

<p><strong>Public Spaces:</strong> Ideal for high-contact areas such as door handles, handrails, tables, and counters in offices, schools, and public facilities. Our neutral, low-odor antibacterial base provides long-lasting protection against bacteria and viruses while remaining gentle on surfaces and the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Food Processing:</strong> Designed for production lines, workbenches, and packaging areas. The formula meets hygiene standards such as HACCP, effectively removing grease and preventing mold growth without corrosion or odor.</p>

<p><strong>Schools & Educational Facilities:</strong> Ensures clean, safe environments for classrooms, libraries, and gyms. Gentle, child-safe formulations protect health while maintaining high hygiene standards.</p>

      <h3>Livestock Hygiene</h3>
<p>We provide safe, long-lasting antibacterial solutions to reduce pathogen risks in livestock environments, supporting sustainable and biosecure farming operations.</p>

<p><strong>Cowsheds:</strong> In cowsheds, where humidity and waste can promote bacterial growth, our antibacterial mother liquid can be added to disinfectants and cleaners for use on floors, walls, feeding and watering systems, and milking equipment. It helps maintain a hygienic environment, reduces cleaning frequency and labor, and is non-toxic, low-odor, and safe for both workers and animals.</p>

<p><strong>Mushroom Cultivation:</strong> In mushroom cultivation, bacteria and mold on growing media or equipment can affect quality and yield. Our mild, water-based antibacterial solution provides up to 15 days of protection, preventing contamination while being safe for crops and workers.</p>

<p><strong>Poultry and Eggs:</strong> For poultry and eggs, our neutral, non-corrosive antibacterial formula keeps eggshells and equipment clean and protected. It prevents mold and bacterial growth, extends egg freshness, and reduces contamination risks during storage and transport.</p>

      <h3>Textile Applications</h3>
<p>We support the production of antibacterial polymer granules and textile products with durable antibacterial properties, combining comfort, safety, and long-term performance.</p>

<p><strong>Bedding:</strong> In bedding, where fabrics stay in contact with the skin for long periods, our antibacterial masterbatch or mother liquid can be added directly into fibers or applied as a surface treatment. It prevents bacteria and mold caused by sweat and moisture, maintaining cleanliness and freshness even after repeated washing.</p>

<p><strong>Automotive Interiors:</strong> In automotive interiors, our technology keeps seats, trims, and mats clean and odor-free by preventing bacterial growth from daily use. It remains effective after friction and cleaning, ensuring a hygienic, comfortable cabin environment that’s safe for families and pets.</p>

<p><strong>Workwear and Uniforms:</strong> For workwear and uniforms, our antibacterial materials protect clothing used in factories, agriculture, and healthcare. They maintain antibacterial performance after repeated washing, reducing odor and contamination risks while being low-odor, non-irritating, and skin-safe.</p>
